            Hi, I'm Felix Annaman, a passionate guy with a postgraduate degree in Finance and Risk Management. </br>
            My journey has led me to the intersection of finance and technology,</br>
             where I aspire to leverage these powerful tools to drive positive change in the world.

             My fascination with technology has always been a driving force in my life. </br>
            It inspired me to embark on a four-month intensive boot camp in front-end web development,
             where I delved into the realms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
             Through this immersive experience, I honed my skills in crafting captivating user interfaces for websites.

            I have chosen front-end development as my career path because of the immense satisfaction</br>
             I find in bringing my creative ideas to life in the form of functional and visually appealing websites.
             I am excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead in this dynamic field,</br>
              and I am committed to continuously learning and growing as a developer.
