                <h3>Weather-Dashboard</h3>
                <p>This is a weather dashboard app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It retrieves weather data for cities using the 5 Day Weather Forecast API.

                    Features
                    Users can search for a city and see current and future weather conditions for that city.
                    The searched city is added to the search history.
                    Users can click on a city in the search history to see its current and future weather conditions again.
                    Current weather conditions include:
                    City name
